WIP: Attempt to make a 2d tile map utility for Love2d.
This is the demo code to test out the tilemap2d library

## Notes

In the local repo there will be two git repos, this one and the tilemap2d library in /libs/tilemap2d/

So be careful when making changes and committing that you are commiting and making changes to the repo you think you are!
